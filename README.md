Welcome.

In June 2024, after working for over 27 years at ST Engineering (no less under three UENs), I decided to take a break but was fortunate to quickly hold myself accountable by attending a few short but fulfilling 'sprints' in adult learniing programmes conducted by NUS Advanced Computing for Executives (ACE).

One of the notable programmes is the Professional Certificate in Business Analytics.
> The program equips learners with essential skills in data-driven decision-making. Participants gain expertise in descriptive statistics, visual data representation, and algorithm design, enhancing informed business decisions.

Another programme is the Professional Certificate in Trisector Strategy and Innovation for Transformation.

1. Unique Approach: Train-coach model for applied problem-solving.
2. Trisector Lens: Vital for complex problems (e.g., sustainability).
3. Diverse Participants: Open to government, corporate, or non-profit backgrounds.
4. Real Projects: High-quality strategy and innovation addressing real-world challenges.
